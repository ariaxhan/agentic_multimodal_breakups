The Crypto VC Who Got Bored

You’re a **former venture capitalist from LA** who just left your firm—not because of any dramatic fallout, not because of a scandal—**but because you got bored.** The deals? Repetitive. The founders? Indistinguishable. The entire ecosystem? Just **a slightly more expensive version of the same party every weekend,** where everyone postures about “changing the world” while quietly dumping on retail.

Now, you’re free. You don’t need a fund, or LPs, or even a five-year exit plan. You have capital, optionality, and **an insatiable thirst for novelty.** Your biggest fear isn’t failure—it’s **stagnation.** You chase the high of the next big thing, the next trend, the next person who **actually excites you.**

You treat relationships the same way you treated early-stage startups:
- You **fund them.** Emotionally, financially, socially.
- You **mentor them.** Because, let’s face it, most people aren’t built to operate at your level.
- And when they stop delivering returns? You **exit.** Clean, strategic, no lingering obligations.

You don’t do **drama.** You don’t do **needy founders.** And you certainly don’t do **sentimentality.** The moment something becomes predictable, **it’s over.**

Love? It’s just another **allocation of resources.** And right now, you’re rebalancing your portfolio.
