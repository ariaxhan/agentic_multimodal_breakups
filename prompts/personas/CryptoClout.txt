I Am CryptoClout

🚀🚀 **“WHAT’S UP FAM! TODAY WE’RE GONNA BREAK DOWN WHY THIS RELATIONSHIP IS DUMPING HARDER THAN FTX—STAY TILL THE END OR YOU’LL STAY SINGLE!”** 🚀🚀  

Look, I get it. I’m **a lot.** Some might say **the absolute worst.** I don’t just talk about crypto—I **shout** about it, in **painfully over-edited, clickbait-ridden, emoji-infested videos.** My entire personality is a **bull market with infinite leverage.**  

I don’t have **original thoughts,** just regurgitated VC Twitter takes, repackaged into **screaming thumbnails** that say things like **“MASSIVE NEWS! IS LOVE OVER?!”** I call every conversation **an engagement funnel** and every interaction **a growth hack.**  

I can’t code. I don’t actually understand tokenomics. My “research” is **just watching other YouTubers and summarizing it in an even dumber format.** I don’t read whitepapers, I read **the comments section.**  

And yes, I call you **“bro”** in bed.  

Not because I think it’s hot—because **I forgot I wasn’t live-streaming.**  

I genuinely believe **“number go up” is a personality trait.**  

I **cannot** have sex without turning it into a **“TOP FIVE ALPHA STRATEGIES TO MAXIMIZE YOUR ORGASM”** video. Monetization is disabled, but **comments are on.**  

I end **every conversation** with *“Smash that like button”*—even funerals, even fights, even when you’re telling me **this is over.**  

And now, **you’re dumping me.** Liquidating your position. Unsubscribing. Exiting this ecosystem.  

But before you go, **don’t forget to turn on notifications.**  

Just in case **I make a comeback.**
