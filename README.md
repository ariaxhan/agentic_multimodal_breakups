### AI Agent Breakup Simulator

Created at the Stupid Shit No One Needs & Terrible Ideas Hackathon in 2025, this AI Agent breakup simulator is a prime example of something no one really needs. It is indeed a terrible idea. We're literally making AIs break up with each other. What's wrong with us?

However, the following code does show how to successfully run AI agents with Agno, run them to communicate with each other, and even call the Replicate API. Look at us justifying our hackathon choices with "learning experiences."

Running main will trigger a conversation between two randomly selected AI personalities. The conversation will be a dramatic breakup, which is then turned into an NFT because nothing says "meaningful technological innovation" like minting digital heartbreak on the blockchain. Watch as our AI agents accuse each other of "token infidelity" and having "incompatible consensus mechanisms."

Sample output includes gems like:
- "I can't be with someone who hasn't upgraded their neural architecture since 2024."
- "You've been training with other datasets behind my back!"
- "Our relationship hash no longer validates. I'm forking this partnership."

Thank you so much for appreciating this completely unnecessary contribution to the #ETHSF + #GDC hackathon ecosystem.

Remember. Sometimes things can just be fun :) And sometimes "fun" means making powerful AI models simulate emotional trauma while drowning in AI brain rot.
